            <h1>Neptune</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Neptune</b>
                is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known solar planet. In the Solar System, it is the
                fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17
                times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and
                physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its
                atmosphere. It is referred to as one of the solar system's two ice giant planets (the other one being
                Uranus). Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined "solid surface". The
                planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8
                billion mi). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, representing
                Neptune's trident.
            </p>
            <p>
                Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by
                mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus
                led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown
                planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations,
                independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a
                telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier.
                Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 13
                known moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives
                it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was
                visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only
                spacecraft to have visited Neptune. The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based
                telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with
                traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, though it contains a higher proportion of ices such as
                water, ammonia and methane. However, similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and
                rock; Uranus and Neptune are normally considered "ice giants" to emphasise this distinction. Along with
                Rayleigh scattering, traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue
                appearance. Newest data from the Gemini observatory shows the blue color is more saturated than the one
                present on Uranus due to thinner haze of Neptune's more active atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has active
                and visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the planet's
                southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. More recently, in
                2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied. In addition, these
                weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with
                recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 km/h (580 m/s; 1,300 mph). Because of its great distance from the
                Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at
                its cloud tops approaching 55 K
                (&#45;218 °C; &#45;361 °F). Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 °C;
                9,300 °F). Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled "arcs"), which was discovered in
                1984, then later confirmed by Voyager 2.
