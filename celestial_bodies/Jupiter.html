            <h1>Jupiter</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Jupiter</b>
                is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more
                than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less
                than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's
                night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after
                the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one-quarter of its mass and one-tenth
                of its volume. It probably has a rocky core of heavier elements, but, like the other giant planets in
                the Solar System, it lacks a well-defined solid surface. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior
                generates more heat than it receives from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is
                an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is
                divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting
                boundaries. A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has been observed
                since at least 1831.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter's magnetic
                tail is nearly 800 million km (5.3 AU; 500 million mi) long, covering nearly the entire distance to
                Saturn's orbit. Jupiter has 80 known moons and possibly many more, including the four large moons
                discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Io and Europa are about the
                size of Earth's Moon; Callisto is almost the size of the planet Mercury, and Ganymede is larger.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the planet in
                December 1973. Jupiter has since been explored by multiple robotic spacecraft, beginning with the
                Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to 1979, and later with the Galileo orbiter in 1995. In
                2007, the New Horizons visited Jupiter using its gravity to increase its speed, bending its trajectory
                en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet, Juno, entered orbit around Jupiter in July
                2016. Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean
                of Europa.
