            <h1>Venus</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Venus</b>
                is the second planet from the Sun and is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the
                brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be visible
                to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus's orbit is smaller than that of Earth, but its maximal
                elongation is 47°; thus, at latitudes with a day-night cycle, it is most readily visible for up to a few
                hours following the start of sunset or before sunrise. Unlike Mercury, which can only be observed during
                twilight, Venus can be seen in a completely dark sky. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days, but
                rotates around its axis in 243 Earth days. Consequently, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than
                any other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. This
                means that the Sun rises from its western horizon and sets in its east. This retrograde rotation creates
                a synodic day of only 117 Earth days. Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with
                Mercury among the planets in the Solar System.

                The third smallest planet in the Solar System, Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called
                Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition.
                It is radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four
                terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the
                planet's surface is about 92 times the sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m
                (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface
                of any planet in the Solar System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is shrouded
                by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen
                from Earth in light. It may have had water oceans in the past, but after these evaporated the
                temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect. The water has probably photodissociated, and the
                free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a
                planetary magnetic field. Because of the lethal surface conditions, the planet is sometimes referred to
                as Earth's "evil twin".

                As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as long
                as records have existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures and has been a prime
                inspiration for writers and poets as the "morning star" and "evening star". Venus was the first planet
                to have its motions plotted across the sky, as early as the second millennium BCE.

                Its proximity to Earth has made Venus a prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was the
                first planet beyond Earth visited by a spacecraft (Venera 1 in 1961) and the first to be successfully
                landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). The planet's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible
                in the visible spectrum, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan
                orbiter in 1991. Plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, but they are hindered by
                Venus's hostile surface conditions. The possibility of life on Venus has long been a topic of
                speculation; in recent years, the topic has received active research.
