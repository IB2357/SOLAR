            <h1>Uranus</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Uranus</b>
                is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus
                (Caelus), who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of
                Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary radius and
                fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both
                have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For
                this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the
                other giant planets.
            </p>
            <p>
                As with gas giants, ice giants also lack a well defined "solid surface." Uranus's atmosphere is similar
                to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices"
                such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It has the coldest
                planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K
                (&#45;224 °C; &#45;371 °F), and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the
                lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of
                ices and rock.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian
                system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane
                of its solar orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their
                equators. In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light,
                without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets. Voyager 2 remains the only
                spacecraft to visit the planet. Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather
                activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900
                km/h; 560 mph).
