            <h1>The Sun</h1>
            <p>
                The <b>Sun</b>
                is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to
                incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as light,
                ultraviolet, and infrared radiation. It is the most important source of energy for life on
                <a href="Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Sun's radius is about 695,000 kilometers (432,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is
                about 330,000 times that of Earth, comprising about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.
                Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%),
                with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V). As such, it is informally, and not completely accurately,
                referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is actually white). It formed approximately 4.6 billion years
                ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this
                matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar
                System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its
                core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium, and in the process
                converts 4 million tons of matter into energy. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000
                years to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. When hydrogen fusion in its core
                has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will
                undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually
                transforming the Sun into a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to
                engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable but not for about five
                billion years. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known
                as a white dwarf, and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its
                previous fusion.
            </p>
            <p>
                The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times. The Sun was thought
                of by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis
                of some solar calendars. The predominant calendar in use today is the Gregorian calendar which is based
                upon the standard 16th-century interpretation of the Sun's observed movement as actual movement.
